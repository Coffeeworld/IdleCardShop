# IdleCardShop
 A new iteration on my card collector with better overall structure and shop idle mechanics

Very much an early work in progress.

Current functionality:
<ul>
 <li>Add a random card to the player's collection. Via button on GodPanel scene.</li>
 <li>Save the player's collection as a resource file.</li>
 <li>Load the player's colletion via the saved resource file.</li>
 <li>Wipe the player's collection with a button via GodPanel.</li>
 <li>Read a JSON card list into a Dictionary on startup.</li>
</ul>
